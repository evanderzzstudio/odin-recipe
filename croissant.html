    <h3>Greek Yogurt Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm milk</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cold</li>
       
    </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Dough:

In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture.

Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

Shape the dough into a rectangle, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until it's chilled and firm.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Butter Layer:

While the dough is chilling, take the cold butter and place it between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Roll it into a 9x12-inch rectangle.

Place the butter layer in the refrigerator to chill until firm.</li>
        <li>Laminate the Dough:

Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface into a 12x18-inch rectangle.

Place the chilled butter layer in the center of the dough.

Fold one-third of the dough over the butter layer, then fold the other third on top (like folding a letter).

Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll it out into a 12x18-inch rectangle again.

Fold the dough in thirds once more.

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat the Folding and Chilling:

Repeat the rolling and folding process two more times, chilling the dough for 30 minutes between each fold. This creates the layers in the croissants.

</li>
        <li>Shape and Bake:

After the final chilling, roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness.

Cut the dough into triangles, then roll each triangle up from the base to form the croissant shape.

Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rise at room temperature for about 1-2 hours, or until they have doubled in size.</li>
